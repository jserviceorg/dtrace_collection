/*
 * mysqld_pid_fslatency_slowlog.d  Print slow filesystem I/O events.
 *
 * USAGE: ./mysql_pid_fslatency_slowlog.d mysqld_PID
 *
 * This traces mysqld filesystem I/O during queries, and prints output when
 * the total I/O time during a query was longer than the MIN_FS_LATENCY_MS
 * tunable.  This requires tracing every query, whether it performs FS I/O
 * or not, which may add a noticable overhead.
 *
 * TESTED: these pid-provider probes may only work on some mysqld versions.
 *	5.0.51a: ok
